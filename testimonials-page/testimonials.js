The first group of students helped us develop a contact/donor database. The second group worked with us and a startup, Roadies Lab, to create a unique online art gallery featuring the work of suppressed and persecuted artists. Both groups were organized, dedicated, hardworking, creative and a pleasure to work with.",

They knew the assignment without much instruction, only because I was not sure, but I did know there was updates that were needed on our website. The girl power team I had executed the assignment, kudos to Emily Ngo, Anesha Santhanam, Fernanda Molina, and Valeria Cordova Mulvany, these young ladies came together and made it happen. We met every Monday, well maybe not every Monday but for the most part we met, they were eager to satisfy their customer, and that is just what they did. And let me not forget the first initial team who were amazing as well. I will be back for another run at updating our website. This program initiative is great for upcoming new organizations/business that may need that push to get their organization/business started and noticed, and for returning clients such as myself that may need a little more technical support.",

The team produced a web app code that allows our community to collect their thoughts on what they read, publish and share. They had to learn Django from scratch and how to integrate code to a database. They proved that they could accomplish all this within 12 weeks. So more important than the app was their inspiration to others in developing nation communities to code. The project was done using entirely free open source software and so it is accessible to all.",

The CMU Community Partners programs allows us to develop solutions our teams have not had the time to complete projects that enables us to automate processes that were very labor intensive.  They learned new technologies quickly to develop in technologies like WordPress or Radzen that we can continue to support for many years to come, furthering COREâ€™s commitment to our mission to save and heal lives through donation."
